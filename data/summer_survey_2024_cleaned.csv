I also wanted to try different meats and fishes from around the world. A vegetarian diet wasn't always healthy, there was plenty of potential to get addicted to junk such as chocolate and chips. I do care about cruelty to animals and my environment (last night I rescued a hedgehog from the middle of the road). I believe factory farming should be minimised and high quality meat should be prioritised. And obviously animals and fish should not be hunted to extinction. Or bred into hideous meat-producing freaks. Also, for example, sharks should not be hunted for their fins.","It was definitely harder to be a vegetarian in the 1990s, but I also felt I was missing out on high-quality meals. I was befriended by a married couple who gave lavish dinner parties. They were tolerant of my vegetarianism, but I was tempted to try all the other dishes they were serving.
