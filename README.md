## Clustering Analysis Report
An overview of the clustering results and insights.

### Introduction
This report presents the results of clustering analysis performed on food consumption patterns, attitudes towards meat/dairy, and dietary preferences. The aim is to identify patterns and group similar data points for further analysis.

### Methods
The clustering method used was K-Means, along with silhouette scores to evaluate the cluster quality.

### Results
Two clusters were found, and upon analysis they divided the Meat Eaters from the Meat-Reducers. Cluster profiles were created by looking at the mean values of each of the features. The radar chart shows that these groups are very separated. 

A demographic exploration of the clusters shows the following: 
- Meat-Eating Cluster 0 has a higher average age, is generally male, and is 'liberal-leaning'. 
- The Meat-Reducing and Plant Based Cluster 1 is slightly younger, generally female, and identifies as 'liberal'


### Conclusion
The clustering analysis successfully identified distinct groups within the dataset. The demographic differences between the data sets can help us understand how to influence attitudes around plant-based diets in the UK.
